# What is this?
This is an "unofficial" director's cut / fork of the [Orbinaut Framework 2](https://github.com/TrianglyRU/OrbinautFramework).

# Is it different?
Yes and no. The idea and overall presentation is practically the same, but there are some modifications:
- All structures have been removed from the main code of the framework.
- The entire codebase has been reviewed with slight changes in code style.
- All recent fixes are included.
- Function names and descriptions have been updated.
- The organization of methods (function variables) has been reworked.
- The palette system has been refined by splitting it into "local" and "global" palettes.
- The animation system has been reworked to more closely match the original Mega Drive engine.

# For what GameMaker version is this for?
Latest available **LTS** (Long-Term Stable) build only. Due to the absence of certain features, like native track looping support, some parts of the code are either missing or temporarily rewritten.

# Is there documentation or support?
No, and there won't be. This is a personal modification I made for myself, but decided to share with others. Therefore, I am not accepting any bug reports and/or feature requests. The framework is provided 'as is'.

# So, is it stable then? What about updates?
Based on my tests, core framework systems are stable and work as intended. The main branch of this repository may (and will) be updated without notice according to my needs or upon discovery of bugs and issues, but no more than once a week.
